# RockPaperInterop

This is a really simple rock-paper-scissors game runner, implemented in
a mixup of C# and F#, in order for me to try out how to interface the two
languages.

The project consists of three parts; a 3-line C# console app, a game engine
with all the rules in F#, and an IO library in C# (mainly as an excuse to
make function calls both ways).

Most of the code was written on the K-day event at Jayway Stockholm on
March 8, 2015.
